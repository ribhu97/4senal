This used to be a Django dump/playground. 

## Current State
~~Currently following the django polls application in the a4senal directory, since I decided to give Django a go (Sorry. Not.)~~
Functionality is ~~non-existent~~ can change one string to another statically, working on making it dynamic
The UI of the extension is available to view right now.
