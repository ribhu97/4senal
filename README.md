# 4senal
Chrome extension that changes Arsenal to 4senal on the web.

## Current State
Currently following the django polls application in the a4senal directory, since I decided to give Django a go (Sorry. Not.)
Functionality is non-existent, only the UI of the extension is available to view right now.

## Introduction
A simple chrome extension that searches the text on the active web page. If it finds Arsenal anywhere in the text,
it changes it to 4senal. 

## Future features
- Change Liverpool to Loserpool
- Change Man City to Man Shitty
